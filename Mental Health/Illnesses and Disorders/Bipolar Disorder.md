# Bipolar Disorder
## What is Bipolar Disorder?
"Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder that can cause intense mood swings" ("Bipolar Disorder" [MedlinePlus]"). Bipolar disorder may also be called "manic-depressive" and "manic-depressive disorder" ("Bipolar Disorder" [MedlinePlus]). Bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition that affects people of all ages. The cause of bipolar disorder is not known.

## Types
There are three main types of bipolar disorder, catergorized by their severity.

### Bipolar I Disorder
Involves either manic episodes that last more than 6 days, or symptoms that require immediate hospitalization as a result of its severity ("Bipolar Disorder" [MedlinePlus]). Indivuduals with Bipolar I Disorder may have common depressive episodes lasting for more than two weeks. Mixed episodes are also possible ("Bipolar Disorder" [MedlinePlus]).

### Bipolar II Disorder
Involves a mixture of depressive episodes and hypomania-less severe versions of a manic episode ("Bipolar Disorder" [MedlinePlus]).

### Cyclothymic Disorder
Less severe than Bipolar I and Bipolar II, individuals with this type of bipolar experience a mixture of depressive episodes and hypomania episodes that are not as severe nor as frequent ("Bipolar Disorder" [MedlinePlus]). Symptoms typically last for two years in adults and one year in children ("Bipolar Disorder" [MedlinePlus]).

## Symptoms
Symptoms of bipolar disorder often vary depending on the type of bipolar disorder and the individual, but mood swings often share similar characteristics ("Bipolar Disorder" [MedlinePlus]).
