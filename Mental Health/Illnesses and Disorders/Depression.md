## Treatments
### Medication
"Antidepressants are prescription medicines to treat depression" ("Antidepressants" [MedlinePlus]).Antidepressants work by improving the way the brain uses certain checmicas that control mood and/or stress ("Antidepressants" [MedlinePlus]). There are different types of antidepressants that can be used to treat depression ("Antidepressants" [MedlinePlus]). Some of the newer medications include Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and Atypical antidepressants ("Antidepressants" [MedlinePlus]).

When taking antidepressants, side effects may include Nausea and vomiting, Weight gain, Diarrhea, Sleepiness, and others ("Antidepressants" [MedlinePlus]).

### Psychotherapies (Talk Therapy)
Psychtherapy involves indentifying and changing "troubling emotions, thoughts, and behavior." ("Psychotherapies" [MedlinePlus]). "Most psychotherapy takes place with a licensed, trained mental health professional and a patient meeting one-on-one or with other patients in a group setting" ("Psychotherapies" [MedlinePlus]).

## Living with Depression
In addition to treatment, there are several options to reduce its impact on everyday living. Regular exercise has been recogized as a effective way to mitigate the symptoms of depression ("Depression" [Mayoclinic]). This is because exercise releases "feel-good endorphins" and keeps the mind off negative thoughts. Regular exercise can also help build confidence, gain more social interaction, and cope with depression.
