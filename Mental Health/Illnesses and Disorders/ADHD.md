# ADHD (Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)
## What is ADHD?
ADHD is a "neurobehavioral disorder" that "interferes with a person's ability to stay on a task and to exercise age-appropriate inhibition" ("Attention" [NINDS]). ADHD is typically diagnosed during childhod but symptoms may occur and/or persist in adulthood ("Attention" [NINDS]).

## Symptoms
ADHD is characterized by a number of symptoms, including: Inattention, Hyperactivity, and Impulsivity ("Attention" [MedlinePlus]). It should be noted that specific symptoms may vary from person to person and are not always present. Questions regards the diagnosis of ADHD as well as other mental health illnesses should be directed to a mental health professional.

Specifc criteria for diagnosis of ADHD can be found at the following link: [Symptoms and Diagnosis of ADHD](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/diagnosis.html).

## Treatment
Currently, there is no specific treatment for ADHD. However, there are several options available to help people with ADHD. An individual may be prescribed "methylphenidate (Ritalin) or dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine)", stimulants that decreases impulsivity and hyperactivity while increasing attention ("Attention" [NINDS]). In addition to medication, treatments for ADHD should include "structured classroom management, parent education, and tutoring and/or behavioral therapy" ("Attention" [NINDS]).

## Living with ADHD
Although there is no cure for ADHD, there are several options to reduce its impact on everyday living. Limiting distractions (such as turning off your phone), using organization tools, exercising, and meditating can all help reduce the symptoms of ADHD ("ADHD" [Nemours KidsHealth]). Informing friends and teachers about your condition may also be beneficial as may be able to help manage your symptoms.
