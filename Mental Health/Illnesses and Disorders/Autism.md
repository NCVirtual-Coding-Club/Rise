# Autism
## What is Autism
Autism (known as Autism spectrum disorder or ASD) is a developmental disorder that affects children and adults that begins in childhood and lasts throughout a person’s life ("Autism" [NINDS]). Autism effects how a person thinks, how they communicate, how they learn, and how they behave. ("Autism" [NINDS])

## Symptoms
Because Autism has a wide range of symptoms, it is often referred to as a "spectrum" disorder. It is important to recognize that not everyone with Autism has the related symptoms. Some of the general symptoms are listed below ("Autism" [NINDS]).

### Communication and Interaction
Most of the early symptoms of Autism regarding communication and interaction are related to general developmental shortcomings. Examples include avoiding eye contact, failure to display facial expressions, showing little interest in peers, and not being able to speak or understand others ("Signs" [CDC]).

### Behaviors
Individuals with Autism often "have behaviors or interests that can seem unusual ("Signs" [CDC])". These behaviors may include "getting upset by minor changes", "obessive interests", "Flaps hands, rocks body, or spins self in circles", and "unusual reactions to the way things sound, smell, taste, look, or feel" ("Signs" [CDC]).

### Additional Symptoms
Additional symptoms of autism include delayed language, movement, connitive, and learning skills, hyperatvivity, and unusual reactions to stimuli ("Signs" [CDC]).

## Treatment
Like many mental illnesses, there is neither a cure nor a single standard treatment for Autism ("What" [NICHD]). However, there are many therapies that can help people with Autism. The best treatments for Autism are determined by the individual’s needs and the type of Autism. Potential treatments are listed below with links for more information.
